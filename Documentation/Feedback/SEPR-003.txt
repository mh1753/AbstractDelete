	- the executable for the game
	- the user manual (including editable source)
	- executable test plan and testing results

Change report (30/30): 
The general approach to change management is clearly discussed and with enough level of detail. 

Even though it is a bit concise, test report changes and their rationale clearly discussed.

Methods and plans discussion is is clearly discussed and with enough level of detail. 

Implementation and report (43/55): 
Well-structured discussion of additions and changes with clear references to relevant requirements. A consistent commenting scheme has been established and used to mark new/modified code files. Not all new code is documented with Javadoc-style comments (e.g. BusStoplLevel.java). A minigame has been added but could have been a bit more elaborate and challenging.
